1.  Introduction

   This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about the
   r-type communication protocol between the server and the client.

   The RFC series of notes covers a broad range of interests. The core
   topics are the rules of the game and the UDP protocol suite.
   However, any topic related to client / server communication may be
   acceptable at the discretion of the RFC Editor.

   This protocol is intended to provide a specific service
   and be used between special purpose units such as terminal
   servers or routers and a monitoring host.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119.
